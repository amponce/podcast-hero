## Podcast Hero

I used phaser v3 for some of the game effects and Sketch to create the graphic elements

Visit https://phaser.io/ for more information on the game engine.

#### How to play:

Scroll down the page and locate the hero card. Drag the hero card onto another podcaster to start a battle.

Your hero's health starts at 21pts. Each podcast host that you battle has a different HP count, so pay attention to the values in red. Look for suprise guests and advertiser cards, they will provide you with a sheild of bonus points which you will need as you make progress. The trending and new subscribers cards add to your hero's existing health count.

The game is desktop only for now, maybe mobile will come in the future!

Thanks for checking it out!
